## 🔍 About This Repository
Welcome to the **Threat Hunting Labs** repository! This project is dedicated to hands-on cybersecurity exercises focused on **threat hunting**, **incident detection**, and **forensic analysis**. It aims to provide practical insights into identifying malicious activities, investigating security incidents, and improving detection techniques.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📌 **Realistic Threat Scenarios** – Simulated attack cases to practice detection techniques.
- 🔎 **Threat Intelligence Analysis** – Utilize OSINT tools for intelligence gathering.
- 🛡 **Endpoint & Network Forensics** – Log analysis using SIEM tools (Splunk, Elastic, etc.).
- 📊 **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** – Threat techniques aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- ⚡ **Automated Threat Hunting Scripts** – Python scripts to analyze logs and detect anomalies.
- 🏴‍☠️ **Adversary Emulation** – Simulate real-world attack techniques using Red Team tools.
